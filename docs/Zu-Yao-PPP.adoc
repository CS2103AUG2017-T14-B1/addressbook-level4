== Project: NUS Contact

The NUS Contact is a desktop address book application designed for NUS students, with its enhancements being done with their interests in mind. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

Note: Most enhancements added by me in the NUS Contact are on the UI side

Code contributed: link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T14-B1/main/blob/master/collated/main/ngzuyao.md[functional code] link:https://google.com[unused code]

=== Enhancement Added: Person Information Panel

==== External behaviour

The Person Information Panel is a section of the GUI where it displays the selected contact's detailed information in a more presentable way. 

The Person Information Panel displays the specific class of the information before the value of the information. (e.g. Nickname: Ah Chuang)

Values of the information are indented equally.

The name and custom fields of the contact are displayed on one side of the panel while the rest of the information is displayed on the other side.

==== Justification

Taking up a larger section of the GUI, the information is displayed with a larger font size than it was previously displayed in the Person Card, which allows the user to easily identify the information he/she is looking for.

As one of the features of the NUS Contact is supporting custom information about a contact, there are more information of each contact to be displayed. Thus the need for the larger space taken up by the panel.

Also, by supporting the custom information, there is a need for NUS Contact to display the class of the information before the value of the information.

Splitting up the panel into two sides makes for easier identification of essential/non-essential information about a contact (barring the name and index of the contact).

==== Implementation

Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]

=== Person Information Panel

The person information panel is created using javafx. It should display detailed information of a person when the person is selected from the person list panel. Before any person is selected, the person information panel should be blank.

The event of the selection of a person is registered using the Event Bus system.

The tags and various information of the person are bound to the information in PersonCard with the method bindListeners, so whenever the information updates, the information displayed in the Person Information Panel will change too.

The following shows the usage of the person information panel:

Before selecting a person:

After selecting a person:

The following diagram shows the class diagram for person information panel:

As we can see, it inherits from the UiPart class, and that MainWindow class has access to the panel, which is then displayed in the GUI.
